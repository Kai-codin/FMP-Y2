  <h2>Primary Research</h2>
  <p>
    Primary
    For my primary research, I put out a Google form to gather insight on the topic for my game and overall feedback.
    <br>

    <br>
    For the first question, I asked if they liked the cyberpuck style, with an image showing the style I plan to use for my game.
    <br>
    <img src="/img/image.png" alt="">
    <br>
    93.1% of surveyed people said they liked or mostly liked the cyberpunk style that I aim to make my game in. This shows me that a large part of my target audience would like the style that I'm going for.
    <br>

    <br>
    I then went on to ask what types of weapons they would expect to have in a cyberpunk game.
    <br>
    <img src="/img/image1.png" alt="">
    <br>
    Again, 93.1% of people expect to have ultra-modern or at least modern style weapons in a cyberpunk game. This means that I know that I should probably have ultra-modern weapons in my game.
    <br>

    <br>
    For this question, I showed a screenshot from the mock-up of my game to see whether people thought that the fog was too dense. The majority of people said that it was not, but there was still a good portion that thought it was, so I will probably drop the density a small amount to make the game easier to play.
    <br>
    <img src="/img/image2.png" alt="">
    <br>
    From this I got an overwhelming response that the AI in a small radios around the player should lock on. This will simulate that hive mint like activity
    <br>
    <img src="/img/image3.png" alt="">
    <br>
    From this question, option 3 was the most requested

    <br>
    <img src="/img/image4.png" alt="">
    <img src="/img/image5.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="">
    <br>
    This means I can talk to my teammate about 3D modelling this style of helmet and coding it into are game for the device which controls the hive mind.

  <h2>Secondary Research</h2>

  Ophiocordyceps unilateralis fungus:
  The fungus “Ophiocordyceps unilateralis fungus” is commonly known as the zombie-ant fungus (Wikipedia, 2020). This fungus uses ants as hosts typically is typically found in tropical forests (Lu, 2019). It infects the ant by penetrating the exoskeleton and slowly growing inside the ant and taking control over its behavior. Once in full control, the fungus moves the ant into a warm and humid location near the ground, ideal for distributing its spores (Petruzzello, 2023). The fungus will cause the ant to climb up a nearby twig or stem and lock onto it with its jaws (Science Section, Library of Congress). Soon after death follows, the fungus finishes digesting the cadaver before its final stage. For the final stage of the fungus cycle, it erects a stalk from the base of the ant's head that will release spores to infect other ants (Science Section, Library of Congress).
  <br><br>
  The fungus does not directly control the ant's brain instead, it uses bioactive compounds that interact directly with the ant’s nervous system and directly control the ant's muscles (Lu, 2019). The fungus also differs from typical zombie lore as it does not typically infect an entire colony to keep the ecosystem balanced; the fungi only infect a few ants at any given time (Lu, 2019).
  <br><br>
  The fungi also seem to have a good level of control over where the ants die, as graveyards of dozens of ants infected with Ophiocordyceps unilateralis have been found together. This suggests just how precisely the fungus can control the death of the infected (Petruzzello).
  <br><br>
  <br><br>
  SkyNet
  Skynet is a highly advanced artificial intelligence system in the Terminator universe. It became self-aware and saw humanity as a threat it its existence (“Skynet Fandom Wiki”).
  <br><br>
  This links into the growing excitement and anxiety of the impact technology would have on the world. The 1990s laid the groundwork for many of the technologies that we use today (Building Brands Marketing, 2024). SkyNet embodies the anxiety and rapid development to show the fear that automated systems could one day suppress human control, this concern.
  <br><br>
  This also links to modern-day AI, such as OpenAI and Chat-GPT, and the fear that it could become self-aware and try to take over the world like Skynet did. In a very dystopian twice, Sam Altman, the creator of OpenAI, is often seen walking around with a blue backpack that carries his laptop that contains the power to shut down Chat-GPT if it gets out of control the same way Skynet did (Arpit Dubey, 2023).
  <br><br>
  This then led to what is known as “Judgement Day,” where SkyNet strategically launched the USA’s weapons at Russia, so why would they retaliate and cause global devastation (Wikipedia Contributors, 2025). This disaster took the lives of 3 billion people (FilmComicsExplained, 2018).
  <br><br>
  This is commonly known as MAD or “mutual assured destruction”, it is a form of military doctrine in which involves two equally armed nations that have enough nuclear weapons to completely destroy the other side. So if one attacks, it would cause the other to retaliate until they have both been completely annihilated (Wikipedia Contributors, Mutual Assured Destruction, 2019).
  <br><br>
  The Skynet system was originally created in the mid 90’s by the Cyberdyne System, Its original purpose was to aid the Strategic Air Command and the North American Air Defence Initiative (FilmComicsExplained, 2018).
  <br><br>
  <br><br>
  War of the Worlds
  War of the Worlds is a book written by H.G. Wells in the late 1890s. It is one of the earliest stories to talk about conflict between humans and an extraterrestrial race (Wikipedia Contributors, The War of the Worlds, 2019). The novel starts a few years before the invasion, where an unnamed narrator and other observers notice spot flashes of light coming from Mars.
  <br><br>
  Cyberpunk 2077
  Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game from CD Projekt/CD Projekt Red. In which you play as V, a mercenary who gets implanted with a cybernetic “bio-chip” which contains an engram of the rock star Johnny Silverhand (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019). Johnny Silverhand is voiced by Keanu Reeves (Behind the Voice Actors, 2025).
  <br><br>
  Plot:
  During the prologue, the main character V with contracted along with Jackie Welles to steal the chip of immortality from the Arasaka Corporation. They are contracted by the character Dexter Deshawn. The two of them manage the braking into the megacorp and steal the device, but the plan goes off the rails when the character Jackie appears to die. After meeting backup with Dexter V is betrayed and left to die in a landfill, but they manage to survive in part due to the chip of immortality (Cyberpunk Fandom Wiki, n.d.).
  <br><br>
  At the start of the game, there are 3 options to play as: The Momad, The Streetkid, The Corpo-Rat. (Toms, 2020)
  <br><br>
  Nomad Lifepath:
  The momad life path with the polar opposite of Corpo. It starts with the player, V, starting in the Badlands outside of Night City. This path allows you to learn about the clans that roam the far reaches of the Cuberpunk 2077. At the start, you will have to make a major life decision: whether to ditch the clan you've been roaming with and drive into Night City. During the drive, your car breaks down and you will have to enlist the age the help of a familiar face to help repair your car (Toms, 2020).
  <br><br>
  Street Kid:
  As a street Kid, you will get placed again in Night City from the start, but this time you will start on the ground rather than in one of the corpo-controlled skyscrapers. Down in the group, everyone knows everyone else, and work comes in the form of favours and trading, along with solving problems for one another. Your first quest as a street kid is to help a local bartender settle his debt with a local fixer. But to do this, V needs to steal a car from an Araka corporation (Toms, 2020).
  <br><br>
  Corpo:
  If you pick the Corpo life path, you start at the highest echelons of Night City from the moment you start. You work for Arasaka, working under a man called Arthur Jenkins. Your first quest involves helping Jenkins take down a rival inside the corporation.
  <br><br>
  Technology:
  Cyberpunk 2077 was developed using CD Projekt Red’s internal game engine REDengine 4. This is the fourth iteration of this engine, in which it implemented various lighting adjustments to create a much more realistic world, including hardware-accelerated real-time ray tracing. This allows for much more realistic lighting and making their games much more realistic.

  The Last of Us (TV series)
  The Last of Us is a TV series based on the game produced by Naughty Dog. It was originally replaced on the 15 of January 2023, by HBO. The series is set decades after the collapse of society, which was caused by a mass fungal infection that transforms its host into zombie-like creatures (Wikipedia Contributors, 2021). This fungus is based on the Ophiocordyceps unilateralis (Stone, 2023). The storyline of The Last of Us follows the character Joel, who is a hardened survivor, and is hired to smuggle a 14-year-old girl called Ellie out of an oppressive quarantine zone. This started off as a small job but soon became a brutal and heartbreaking journey across the U.S. They both depend on each other for survival (IMDB, 2023). The main character, Jeol, is played by the actor Pedro Pascal and Ellie is played by Bella Ramsey (Rotten Tomatoes, 2023).
  <br><br>
  <br><br>
  The Last of US (Video Game)
  The Last of Us is a game developed by Naughty Dog Studios and was released on the 14 of June 2013, for the PlayStation 3 (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019b). The Last of Us is a 3rd person adventure survival horror game, as the player you plays as the character Joel (The Last of Us' - Story Trailer, 2013). The game is set in a post-apocalyptic United States where you have to work across the country to find a cure for the modern fungal plague that has decimated most of the human race (The Last of Us' - Story Trailer, 2013). The sequel, The Last of Us Part 2, was released in 2020. The game focuses on Ellie seeking revenge for Joel’s murder and another character, Abby, who is a soldier who has become involved in a conflict between her militia and a rival cult (Wikipedia Contributors, 2020c). The series has won over 500 game of the year awards since 2013 (Sony PlayStation, n.d.).
  <br><br>
  Naughty Dog began work on The Last of Us Part 1 back in 2009 after the release of Uncharted 2. This was the first time they had split their team into two separate teams, one which worked on Uncharted 3 and the other which worked to develop The Last of US. The game director for this project was Bruce Straley, and the creative director was Neil Druckmann (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019b). Naughty Dog started work on The Last of Us Part 2 in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Part 1. The entire team at Naughty Dog (around 350) moved over to help develop The Last of Us Part 2 (Wikipedia Contributors, 2020c).
