            <h3>Rationale</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my time on the games productions course I have learnt a lot of skills that I will use on this project. Some of the skills I want to implement on this project are, AI enemies, I would like to have AI enemies in my game for the player to fight and I would like to try and use AI for the NPC characters in my game. I would also like to use some more advanced materials to enhance the feel of my game as well as more advanced materials, I would also make use of the foliage system in unreal engine to make parts of the map look really abandoned and destroyed. I hope I will be able to use all of these skills to make a highly detailed and immersive map that will allow the player to enjoy it for hours. I will also be using the blueprinting skills I have learnt throughout my time on the cause to create lots of fun interactive elements on the map. I would also use blueprinting to add to the player's experience and bring the map to life.

            <h3>Project concept</h3>
            <p>
                The plan for my game is a rogue AI that has taken control and has brought everyone under its control in one big hive mind. The aim of the game is to take out the AI and bring everyone back from the hive mind. I would like to look into real examples like, zombie ants and neuralink. The story of the game is that people have gotten brain chips and now the AI has gone rogue and taken control over everyone. The main character has been in a coma due to a faulty brain chip allowing them to escape from the AI's controls. I would like to go out and record some of my own folie sound effects for foot steps on different surfaces to allow the player to be more immersed into the game. The player will have to escape from the main ai controlled compound into the barren waste land that surrounds it to find resources to take out the ai. This will include things such as weapons and tools that will allow the player in the boss fight. Once they have their tools they will have pusles to complease back in the compound to weaken the AI so it's able to be defeated. They will then have to fight there way up the tower to get to the main bit at the top where the AI brain is that the player can then defeat

            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>
                This section provides an opportunity for you to explain how you will reflect on and evaluate your work, as both an ongoing activity and at the conclusion of your project. You should describe how you intend to record your decision making and how you will document changes to your ideas as your work progresses. The evaluation should be referenced to your stated aims and be reflective and analytical rather than a description of actions completed. When working in collaboration with others you should comment on how this may impact either positively or negatively and steps you can take to minimise disruption in your own progress.
